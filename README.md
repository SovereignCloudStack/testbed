This repository contained a fork from OSISM testbed to develop specific
features. However, as all relevant pieces were merged upstream, there
was not much activity here and the repository fell behind the upstream
origin.
An outdated repo is confusing at best, so let's rather not use it.

Please use the upstream
https://github.com/OSISM/testbed
repository directly.
