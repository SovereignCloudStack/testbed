Hints how to get SCS/OSISM testbed working on OTC
=================================================

- Use ENVIRONMENT=otc, referencing the included environment-otc.tfvars.
  dhcp needs to be enabled and the DNS nameserver is set to the OTC
  DNS (with quad9 fallback).
- As on many other clouds, you need to apply neutron-az.patch to disable
  network AZ hints
- You need to add "enable_snat = true" to the router in neutron.tf, you
  can do so by applying the patch neutron-snat.patch (after the above-
  mentioned patch).
- I created an image Ubuntu 20.04. The ones from the OTC
  (Standard_Ubuntu_20.04_latest) would be fine except that they have a too
  small min_disk. So I created a volume from the OTC image, took an image
  from it and reregistered with --min-disk 20. On KVM flavors, you can also
  register Ubuntu images downloaded from upstream, but I have not recently
  tested it. I'm using the OTC images as I know that the team does a good job
  in maintaining and optimizing them and I have the flexibility to use Xen
  flavors (OK, irrelevant by now) and BMS flavors (very relevant).
  If you use OTC images, apply the patch docker-ansible.patch to ensure the
  right packages are installed. (This adds docker and removes ansible-2.9.6.)
- In case you have spotted environment-otc-physical.tfvars: This is for
  deploying SCS/OSISM testbed on Bare Metal flavors (BMS). It does not yet
  work, though.
- Like on any other platform, you need terraform with the OpenStack provider.
  Optionally, you can use the OTC terraform provider.
